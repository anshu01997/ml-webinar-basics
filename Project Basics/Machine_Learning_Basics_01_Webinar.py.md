# Machine Intelligence 
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with algorithms that allow computers to learn. What this means, in most cases, is that an algorithm is given a set of data and infers information about the properties of the data—and that information allows it to make predictions about other data that it might see in the future. In simple terms, it gives  **preditive power** to computers !

# Machine Learning vs Artificial Intelligence
- Aritificial Intelligence is a system which interacts with surroundings
- AI systems have sensors to collect data from surroundings
- Machine Learning can be considered as the **"brain of AI"** which process the input data
- ML algorithm frames an appropriate answer, and which is sent back back to the surroundings.

### Example of Self-Driving Car
- Input data - Set of images caputured by the sensor

- Processing by Machine Learning Algorithm - A model trained on images processes it, looks for any obstacles 

- Output is a required 'float' value as the output, giving the required acceleration of the car.

# Why the Hype ?
 - Every minute up to 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube.

 - Average of 31.25 million messages and view 2.77 million videos every minute on Facebook.
 -  More data has been created in the past two years than in the entire previous history of the human race.
 - At the moment less than 0.5% of all data is ever analyzed and used, just imagine the potential here

# Different Machine Learning Approaches
## Supervised Learning
- Algorithms to get a set of *Labeled Data* called Training Data
- Predictions are made on a set of *Unlabled Data* called Testing Data
- Example - Spam Filtering in emails, Obstacle Detection in Images, Classifying Fruits

- Algorithm is trained using a model, which is based on various parameters called features.

| Color(X)      | Sweetness(Y)    | Label  |
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|
| 0.80       | 0.90          |   Apple |
| 0.80       | 0.84          |   Apple |
| 0.10       | 0.27          |   Lemon |
| 0.30       | 0.47          |   Lemon |
| 0.83       | 0.83          |   Apple |
| 0.60       | 0.97          |   Apple |

## Unsupervised Learning
- Algorithm don't get set of labeled data
- Algorithm automatically extracts hidden patterns from the data.
- Mostly used to classify data into various sets, similar data is clubbed into a single set called a cluster. 
- Example: Clustering Algorithms to classify a set of related data into a single cluster
<br><br>

| Color(X)      | Sweetness(Y)    
| ------------- |-------------:|
| 0.80       | 0.87          |  
| 0.80       | 0.83          |  
| 0.10       | 0.27          |  
| 0.30       | 0.47          |  
| 0.83       | 0.82          |  
| 0.60       | 0.97          |  
## Reinforcement Learning
- It has a feedback element to improve its performance
- Based upon the idea of "reward", algorithm will move in a direction to achieve maximum reward.
- Good Application : Teaching Machine to play games like Tic-Tac-Toe,Chess etc
- Algorithms uses moves tried in the past which led to successful results

# Probability Distribution 
## Random Variable
 Random variable is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random experiment.
 
 For eg - 
 1) A random variable could denote number of characters in all the books in the world
 2) Length of movie names in all the movies released so far
 3) Outcomes of dice throw experiment
 

### Mean and Expectation
    u  = E(X)
    u is the mean
    E(X) is the expected value of X.

## Normal/Gaussian Distribution
![](images/normal_distribution.svg)
Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.

## Standard Normal Distribution

## Multivariate Normal Distribution

# KNN Algorithm

- The K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm measures the distance between a query scenario and a set of scenarios in the data set.
- KNN falls in the supervised learning family of algorithms. Informally, this means that we are given a labelled dataset consisting of training observations (x,y) and would like to capture the relationship between x and y. 
- This method used for classification and regression.
